What have we done till now ill be stored here so  anyone reading this will be able to understand how the 
things have been working!

we have created this app using next js command
we have enabled and installed many dev dependencies such as 

->typescript
->Eslint
->Turbopack
->tailwind
->we also have used the app router so that we can route using the app feature

we have installed other things such as axios, instead of using the conventional method of fetch we have 
used the axios method.

we also have installed bcrypt.js so that we can do the encrypting, as we dont want to store the password
in the db in text format.

we have installed jsonwebtoken so that we can manage cookies and also manage data using jwt and we have 
installed nodemailer so that we can shoot out email using simple gmail format or other mail applications
later we have installed react-hot-toast so we can have small pop up messages, such that you have login in
successfully and we also have installed mongoose by which we are able to talk to the database
